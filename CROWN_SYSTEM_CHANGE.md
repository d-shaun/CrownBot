## A change in the Crown system

The crowns will no longer be registered under Discord user ID but instead your Last.fm usernameâ€•meaning **if you change your Last.fm username on the bot**, you **won't retain crowns you've acquired from previous Last.fm username(s)**.
You can have multiple Discord accounts with the same Last.fm username, but not switch between multiple Last.fm usernames on the same Discord account and still retain all the crowns.

This is to prevent one logging in as any username they want and stack crowns they don't own.

Feel free to share if you have anything to say about this change.

```
--&login abc
--&w x
(x crown registered under 'abc' username)

--&login cdy
(you'll be asked to confirm deleting that 'x' crown registered under 'abc')
--&w y
(y crown registered under 'cdy' username)
```
