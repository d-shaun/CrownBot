# CrownBot Privacy Policy

> Last updated: April 2023

Discord/shaun#4761 ("we", "us", or "our") operates the CrownBot (the "Service"), a Discord bot. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, and disclose personal data when you use our Service, and your rights in relation to this data.

## Information Collection and Use

We collect and retain Last.fm usernames provided explicitly by users who interact with CrownBot by sending a message containing a login command followed by their username. We also store the Discord ID of the user in order to link it to the corresponding Last.fm username in our database. We use this information solely to fetch users' playcounts and other statistics from the Last.fm API, for the purpose of generating charts and graphs to rank users of the Discord server based on their playcount for artists. We do not share this information with any third parties, nor do we use it for any other purposes than those stated above.

## Data Retention

We retain Last.fm usernames and associated Discord IDs as long as the user is actively using CrownBot. If users choose to log out from CrownBot, we will delete the associated Last.fm username and Discord ID from our database.

## Your Rights

Users have the right to access their personal data, as well as to correct, delete, or restrict the processing of their data. To exercise these rights, users can log out from CrownBot or contact the bot maintainer.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us.
