## Inviting the bot to your server

Because of Discord's new bot verification system, the bot **cannot to join new servers** (since October 7, 2020).

This new system requires me to submit my “identity document(s) like a driver's license, ID card, or passport” to Stripe, which is something I'm really not comfortable with—especially for a small bot of this sort that I run for users free of cost—however “legit” Stripe and Discord might be. So, the bot hasn't been "verified" and the above-mentioned restriction has taken place.

Here's a blog post from Discord explaining this new system:
